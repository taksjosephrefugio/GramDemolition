Contains files that I find helpful when using any generic linux-based machine

# Vim Config File `.vimrc`
Obviously, save `.vimrc` to your root directory (i.e. `~/`)

# Aliases `.bash_aliases`
1. Copy `.bash_aliases` to your root directory (i.e. `~/`)    
:bulb: Make sure that `commandCenter` commands have  the correct directory address on `.bash_aliases`
2. Restart aliases by typing the command: `source ~/.bashrc`

# commandCenter
Save the directory `commandCenter/` to Documents (i.e. `~/Documents`)
